         Return the length of the longest substring containing all the same letter you can get after performing at most `k` replacements.

     Brute-force Approach:
     - Start with each index `i` and explore every possible substring ending at index `j`.
     - Track the frequency of characters in the current window.
     - If the number of characters that need to be replaced (i.e., the length of the substring minus the frequency of the most frequent character) exceeds `k`, stop and move to the next starting index `i`.
     - Keep track of the longest valid substring found.

     Time Complexity: O(n^2) — two nested loops.
     Space Complexity: O(k) — HashMap to store frequencies of characters.

     Better Approach: Sliding Window using HashMap
     - Use a sliding window technique with two pointers (`left` and `right`).
     - Track the frequency of characters within the window using a HashMap.
     - If the window is valid (i.e., the number of characters needing replacement does not exceed `k`), expand the window by moving the `right` pointer.
     - If the window becomes invalid (i.e., we need more than `k` replacements), move the `left` pointer to shrink the window.
     - Recalculate the maximum_frequency as well. 
     - The recalculation of `maximum_frequency` involves checking the entire `HashMap` to find the highest frequency, which takes **O(26)** time since we have at most 26 possible characters (for uppercase English letters).
     - Keep updating the maximum length of valid windows found.
      
     Time Complexity: O(n * 26) — We pass through the string once and recalculate the `maximum_frequency` by checking 26 characters at most.
     Space Complexity: O(k) — HashMap stores frequencies of characters in the window.

      **Why Not Update `maximum_frequency` During Shrinking?**
         - When the window becomes invalid (i.e., `window_length - maximum_frequency > k`), we shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer.
         - At this point, it's not necessary to update `maximum_frequency` immediately because the goal is to remove characters from the window and make it valid again. As the window shrinks, `maximum_frequency` will automatically reflect the new window's valid maximum frequency.
         - Recalculating `maximum_frequency` is not required after each shrink, as we are ensuring the new window will always have valid frequencies after the left pointer moves, and we will already check whether it's valid by the condition `(window_length - maximum_frequency > k)`.
